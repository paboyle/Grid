* - BinaryWriter, TextWriter etc...
  - use protocol buffers? replace xmlReader/Writer ec..
  - Binary use htonll, htonl

* Stencil operator support                           -----Initial thoughts, trial implementation DONE.
                                                     -----some simple tests that Stencil matches Cshift.
                                                     -----do all permute in comms phase, so that copy permute
						     -----cases move into a buffer.
						     -----allow transform in/out buffers spproj


* CovariantShift support                             -----Use a class to store gauge field? (parallel transport?)


* Consider switch std::vector to boost arrays or something lighter weight
  boost::multi_array<type, 3> A()...    to replace multi1d, multi2d etc..


* norm2l is a hack. figure out syntax error and make this norm2 c.f. tests/Grid_gamma.cc

****  std::vector replacement;

  Had to change "reserve" back to "resize" on std::vector in Lattice class.

  This forces the constructor call on EVERY element of the array with negative
  performance effects on temporaries.
  
  The reversion was required because copy constructur has to work.

  CONCLUSION: I must implement a similar to vector without construction/fill on
  resize. Find out if valarray or alternative works differently prior to 
  doing this since there may still be something I can use..


* Make the Tensor types and Complex etc... play more nicely.
* TensorRemove is a hack, come up with a long term rationalised approach to Complex vs. Scalar<Scalar<Scalar<Complex > > >
  QDP forces use of "toDouble" to get back to non tensor scalar. This role is presently taken TensorRemove, but I
  want to introduce a syntax that does not require this.


* Optimise the extract/merge SIMD routines; Azusa??
 - I have collated into single location at least.
 - Need to use _mm_*insert/extract routines.


* Conformable test in Cshift routines.


* Flavour matrices?
* Pauli, SU subgroup, etc.. 
* su3 exponentiation & log etc.. [Jamie's code?]
* TaProj


* Fourspin, two spin project --- DONE


* Parallel MPI2 IO

* rb4d support for 5th dimension in Mobius.
