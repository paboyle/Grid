i) Clean up CoarsenedMatrix, GeneralCoarsenedMatrix, GeneralCoarsenedMatrixMultiRHS

 -- Ideally want a SINGLE implementation that does MultiRHS **AND** works with one RHS.

 -- -- Getting there. One RHS is hard due to vectorisation & hardwired coarse5d layout
 -- Compromise: Wrap it in a copy in/out for a slice.
 
 -- Bad for Lanczos: need to do a BLOCK Lanczos instead. Longer term.

 -- **** Make the test do ONLY the single RHS. ****
 -- I/O for the matrix elements required.
 -- Make the Adef2 build an eigenvector deflater and a block projector

-----
* Forces; the UdSdU  term in gauge force term is half of what I think it should
  be. This is a consequence of taking ONLY the first term in:

  dSg/dt = dU/dt dSdU + dUdag/dt dSdUdag

  in the fermion force.

  Now, S_mom = - tr Pmu Pmu      ; Pmu anti-herm

                                  .
       d Smom/dt = - 2.0 tr Pmu Pmu   = - dSg/dt = - tr Pmu [Umu dSdUmu + UmuDag dSdUmuDag]

           .
       => Pmu =  Umu dSdUmu

       Where the norm is half expected.

  This means we must double the force in the Test_xxx_force routines, and is the origin of the factor of two.
  This 2x is applied by hand in the fermion routines and in the Test_rect_force routine.

* Support different boundary conditions (finite temp, chem. potential ... )

- Sign of force term.

- Reversibility test.

- Rename "Ta" as too unclear

- Lanczos

- Audit oIndex usage for cb behaviour

- Prepare multigrid for HMC. - Alternate setup schemes.

- Support for ILDG --- ugly, not done

- Flavour matrices?

- FFTnD ?

- Gparity; hand opt use template specialisation elegance to enable the optimised paths ?

- Gparity force term; Gparity (R)HMC.

- Mobius implementation clean up to rmove #if 0 stale code sequences

- CG -- profile carefully, kernel fusion, whole CG performance measurements.

================================================================
* Hacks and bug fixes to clean up and Audits
================================================================

*  Extract/merge/set cleanup ; too many variants; rationalise and call simpler ones

*  Rewrite core tensor arithmetic support to be more systematic
 =  Use #define repetitive sequences to minimise code, decrease line count by thousands possible,
    with more robust and maintainable implementation.

*  Ensure we ET as much as possible; move unop functions into ET framework.
   - tests with expression args to all functions

* FIXME audit

* const audit

Insert/Extract
* Replace vset with a call to merge.; 
* care in Gmerge,Gextract over vset .
* extract / merge extra implementation removal      
* Optimise the extract/merge SIMD routines; Azusa??
 - I have collated into single location at least.
 - Need to use _mm_*insert/extract routines.

* Thread scaling tests Xeon, XeonPhi

Not sure of status of this -- reverify. Things are working nicely now though.

* Make the Tensor types and Complex etc... play more nicely.

  - TensorRemove is a hack, come up with a long term rationalised approach to Complex vs. Scalar<Scalar<Scalar<Complex > > >
    QDP forces use of "toDouble" to get back to non tensor scalar. This role is presently taken TensorRemove, but I
    want to introduce a syntax that does not require this.

  - Reductions that contract indices on a site should always demote the tensor structure.
    norm2(), innerProduct.

  - Result of Sum(), SliceSum // spatial sums
              trace, traceIndex etc.. do not.

  - problem arises because "trace" returns Lattice<TComplex> moving everything down to Scalar,
    and then Sum and SliceSum to not remove the Scalars. This would be fixed if we 
    template specialize the scalar scalar scalar sum and SliceSum,  on the basis of being
    pure scalar.
